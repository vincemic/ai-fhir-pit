### ~~Missing Creation Forms~~ ‚úÖ **ALL CREATION FORMS NOW IMPLEMENTED**
All resource types now have full creation forms available in the standardized modal!

## Form Components Status

### Complete Form Components (8 types)
- `PatientFormComponent` - Full implementation
- `PractitionerFormComponent` - Full implementation
- `OrganizationFormComponent` - Full implementation
- `LocationFormComponent` - Full implementation
- `ObservationFormComponent` - Full implementation
- `ConditionFormComponent` - Full implementation
- `ProcedureFormComponent` - Full implementation
- `CoverageFormComponent` - Full implementation

### Placeholder Form Components (5 types)
The following have basic placeholder forms that only display resource type and basic information:
- `EncounterFormComponent` - Needs full implementation for viewing/editing
- `MedicationStatementFormComponent` - Needs full implementation for viewing/editing
- `DiagnosticReportFormComponent` - Needs full implementation for viewing/editing
- `ImmunizationFormComponent` - Needs full implementation for viewing/editing
- `AllergyIntoleranceFormComponent` - Needs full implementation for viewing/editing

**Note**: All resource types now have creation forms in the standardized modal, but some still need improved viewing/editing form components.

### Default Fallback
- `DefaultResourceFormComponent` - Generic form for any unsupported resource types

## ‚úÖ Recent Completion Status

### ~~Recommendations for Completion~~ **COMPLETED!**

All creation forms have been successfully implemented! The following were recently added:

### ‚úÖ High Priority - COMPLETED
1. **Coverage Creation Form** - ‚úÖ Added to standardized modal component
2. **Encounter Creation Form** - ‚úÖ Added to standardized modal component  
3. **MedicationStatement Creation Form** - ‚úÖ Added to standardized modal component

### ‚úÖ Medium Priority - COMPLETED
4. **DiagnosticReport Creation Form** - ‚úÖ Added to standardized modal component
5. **Immunization Creation Form** - ‚úÖ Added to standardized modal component
6. **AllergyIntolerance Creation Form** - ‚úÖ Added to standardized modal component

### Remaining Tasks
The only remaining improvements needed are for the viewing/editing form components (not creation forms):
- Replace placeholder viewing forms with full implementations for Encounter, MedicationStatement, DiagnosticReport, Immunization, and AllergyIntolerance

### Implementation Notes
- All creation forms are now fully implemented in the standardized modal component
- Creation forms follow FHIR R4 specification requirements for each resource type
- All creation forms support proper validation and FHIR-compliant resource generation
- Viewing form components for some resource types still use placeholder implementations and could be enhanced
