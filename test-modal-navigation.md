# Modal Architecture - Updated

## Current Modal System

The application now uses a unified modal architecture with the following components:

### Core Components
1. **StandardizedResourceFormModalComponent** - Handles all resource creation and editing
2. **StandardizedResourceModalService** - Service for managing resource modals
3. **ModalService** - Core modal management service
4. **ModalComponent** - Base modal component

### Removed Components (No longer in use)
- ❌ ResourceFormModalComponent (replaced by StandardizedResourceFormModalComponent)
- ❌ ResourceModalService (replaced by StandardizedResourceModalService)
- ❌ ModalContainerComponent (removed to fix dual modal issue)
- ❌ StandardizedResourceViewModalComponent (removed - always use edit mode)

## Current Implementation

### Search Component
- Uses `StandardizedResourceFormModalComponent` directly in template
- All search results open in edit mode (no view-only)
- Uses `StandardizedResourceModalService.openEditModal()`

### Create Component  
- Uses `StandardizedResourceFormModalComponent` directly in template
- Uses `StandardizedResourceModalService.openCreateModal()`

### Modal Demo Component
- Uses `StandardizedResourceFormModalComponent` for demonstrations
- Uses `StandardizedResourceModalService` for modal operations

## Benefits of Current Architecture
- ✅ Single modal system (no conflicts)
- ✅ Consistent edit forms across all components  
- ✅ Always populated modal data
- ✅ Simplified codebase
- ✅ No view-only modals (always edit mode as requested)
